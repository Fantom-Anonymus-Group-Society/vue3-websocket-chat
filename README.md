# Vue 3 + Vite

To start project just build it and run. (But don't forget to create env.js)

```bash
    cp env.example.js env.js
    make build
    make start
```

Backend is here: <a href="https://github.com/Fantom-Anonymus-Group-Society/fastapi-websokcet-chat">Tap</a>

Just run them together.

Maybe in future I'll write docs. Maybe not. And doc strings. If you want, you may do it.
